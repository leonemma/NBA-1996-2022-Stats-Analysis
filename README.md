## Background
The NBA is one of the most popular sports in the world. Top basketball players from all over the globe dream of reaching the level required to earn a spot in this highly competitive league.
In this analysis, we will explore the NBA from the 1996 season to 2023. Our analysis will focus on differences in key basketball metrics each year, as well as the players who stood/stand out during different periods.  

## Data Source
The dataset is available on Kaggle (Justinas Cirtautas ![NBA Players](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data/data)).   
This dataset consists of  22 columns and 12844 observations and contains individual players multiple times due to the collection of their statistics every year.

That's why we will split our analysis in two parts:
1. Analyzing the NBA over the years
2. Transforming the dataset to represent NBA players average career stats
